## Description

The Charmed MySQL Router Operator is a database proxy for [Group Replicated
MySQL](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/mysql-innodb-cluster-introduction.html)
clusters.

MySQL Router is a middleware that provides transparent routing of MySQL servers
and client applications. More info at [MySQL
Router](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/mysql-router/8.0/en/).

The proxy sits between the MySQL cluster and a client application, e.g.:

```mermaid

    id2 --db--> id3[(MySQL Cluster)]
```
